This's application for starting build of all branches of one application that's connected to App Center.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This's regular console application.
Before you start it you need to configure four things in App.config file.
1) key = "baseApi" - this parameter is for API location of App Center it can be found here: https://openapi.appcenter.ms/#/
2) key = "user" - username of user that is used on App Center application
3) key = "application" - name of application that is used in App Center
4) key = "token" - token can be user or app token, it's all the same. 
	For generating tokens you can find more info here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/api-docs/

Next step is to start application and watch magic happen
